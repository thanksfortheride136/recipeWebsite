    <h4>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts: 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Olive Oil: 2 tablespoons to ensure the chicken is moist and gets a nice golden color.</li>
        <li>Fresh Herbs: 2 tablespoons finely chopped (a mix of rosemary, thyme, and parsley works well).</li>
        <li>Garlic: 3 cloves, minced, for added flavor.</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper: To taste, for seasoning.</li>
    </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, chopped herbs, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Rub the herb mixture over the chicken breasts, ensuring they are well-coated.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts in a baking dish and bake for about 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Once done, let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This ensures it remains juicy.</li>
