    <p>Big Lou's Tarimisu, the perfect desert.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ladyfingers (Savoiardi): About 24 pieces. These are the main layers of the Tiramisu.</li>
        <li>Strong Coffee or Espresso: 1 cup, cooled to room temperature. This is for dipping the ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Mascarpone Cheese: 8 oz (227 grams). This gives the Tiramisu its creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Eggs: 3 large eggs, separated. The yolks are used for the creamy mixture, and the whites are whipped to add airiness.</li>
        <li>Sugar: 3/4 cup, for sweetness and texture</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder: For dusting on top.</li>
        <li>Rum or Coffee Liqueur (optional): 2 tablespoons, to mix with the coffee for an extra kick.</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract: 1 teaspoon, for flavo</li>
    </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brew the coffee and allow it to cool to room temperature. Mix in the rum or coffee liqueur if you're using it.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until thick and pale. Add the mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold these into the mascarpone mixture to create a light, airy texture.</li>
        <li>Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring it's soaked but not soggy. Lay the dipped ladyfingers in a single layer in a serving dish.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and then the rest of the mascarpone mixture</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>Before serving, dust the top generously with cocoa powder.vv</li>
